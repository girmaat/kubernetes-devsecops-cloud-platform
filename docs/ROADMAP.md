üìù Project Description
This project implements a production-grade, reusable DevSecOps Kubernetes platform on AWS EKS, designed with GitOps, secure CI/CD, policy enforcement, and progressive delivery in mind. The architecture leverages ArgoCD, Sealed Secrets, Trivy, Kyverno, Cosign, Velero, and more to ensure that application delivery is auditable, resilient, and secure.

While the platform supports any microservice-based application, it includes a test deployment of the my-vote app (vote, result, worker, redis) to validate functionality across CI/CD, policy, secrets, and monitoring layers.

üéØ Project Goals
Category Goals
GitOps ArgoCD-based GitOps bootstrap with multi-environment app-of-apps
CI/CD Security Integrate container scanning (Trivy, Gitleaks), SLSA, and signed artifacts
Secrets Governance End-to-end secure secret handling using IRSA and Sealed Secrets
Progressive Delivery Canary and BlueGreen rollouts for microservices via Argo Rollouts or Helm
Observability Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Fluent Bit for metrics, logs, and alerting
Policy Enforcement Kyverno/Gatekeeper policies to enforce deployment security rules
Backup & Resilience Use Velero for backup and disaster recovery
RBAC & Access Control Fine-grained namespace and secret access using RBAC
Audit & Drift Detection Track configuration drift and audit Kubernetes and GitOps eventsüéØ Goal
Bootstrap a GitOps workflow using ArgoCD to declaratively manage the entire platform and application lifecycle, starting with the "App-of-Apps" pattern. You'll run this both locally on Minikube and later on EKS.

Phased Implementation Plan
Phase Title
0 Project Planning & Directory Scaffolding
1 Provision EKS Cluster with OIDC, CloudWatch, and Nodegroups (via eksctl)
2 Install ArgoCD and Bootstrap GitOps with App-of-Apps
Goal of the Phase
Bootstrap a GitOps workflow using ArgoCD to declaratively manage the entire platform and application lifecycle, starting with the "App-of-Apps" pattern. You'll run this both locally on Minikube and later on EKS.

Lessons & Skills to Learn
Area What You‚Äôll Learn
GitOps Declarative app lifecycle management using ArgoCD
Kustomize + Helm Organizing workloads into environments (dev, prod)
ArgoCD Internals Sync policies, self-healing, automated deployment
Git Structure How to link Git files directly to cluster state
Drift Management Auto-reconciliation and preventing manual changes

‚ùì Problem(s) Solved
Problem How This Phase Solves It
Manual Deployments Replaces kubectl apply with Git-driven auto-sync
Hidden Drift Enables auto-healing and pruning of out-of-sync resources
App Sprawl Centrally manages services with a scalable structure
Onboarding Delays New services are onboarded by just adding Git manifests

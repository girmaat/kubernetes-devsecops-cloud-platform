üß∞ Development Environment Overview
üñ•Ô∏è Virtual Machines (VMs)
VM Name	OS	Tools Installed
bootstrap-vm	Rocky Linux	Development VM
jenkins-vm	Rocky Linux	CI/CD Server (Jenkins)	Jenkins, Docker, Git, role-based auth, ECR credentials => This VM is only for pipeline building only
Minikube-vm	Rocky Linux	Minikube / Kubernetes cluster	Minikube, kubectl, Helm, Kustomize related developments

All VMs are managed via VMware and accessed using VSCode Remote SSH.

üõ°Ô∏è  the following are settings on minikube-vm
Created two local Linux users: dev1, dev2 - for developer 1 and developer 2
Copied Minikube CA cert + key from /var/lib/minikube/certs for signing user certs
Generated TLS certs and kubeconfigs for dev1 and dev2
Created RBAC roles and bindings in sealed-secrets namespace (read-only access)
Installed dev1 and dev2 kubeconfigs into:
/home/dev1/.kube/config
/home/dev2/.kube/config
Installed Sealed Secrets controller via Helm into sealed-secrets namespace

dev1-vm is dedicated to developer with user account dev1
dev2-vm is dedicated to developer with user account dev2
monitor-vm is dedicated to a user with user account monitor
"user" has admin access to all VMs and acts as devopsadmin


üõ°Ô∏è Jenkins : Project-based matrix security enabled

- some of the services must be developed by dev1 while the other services must be developed by dev1
-"user" has to do all devops tasks
-monitoring tasks will be done by monitor

- Every time you send me code, I want to know:
 1) What it does, 
 2) Why it‚Äôs needed 
 3) who is going to do it 
 4) how it connects to my overall DevOps setup and project
5) how a step is related to previous step(s)

1. wherever possible, give me expected outputs and what is happening under the hood, and how to 
2. manually verify what is happening under the hood. 
3. Please, paste code in the chat message, not attachments
4. since I am manually typing the code please give me full detailed descriptions of the code
5. I want to develop, test and push to gitHub little by little. Therefore, tell me when it is time to push the code to github with commit messages***




Please please please stop guess work and assumptions. I am just getting frustrated with your guesses and assumptions. I am happy to send you anything you need so you can provide accurate solutions, verses wasting time guessing.


Any change must not break anything. Tell me if I‚Äôm touching anything critical.
